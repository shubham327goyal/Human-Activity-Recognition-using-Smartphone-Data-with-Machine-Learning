# Human-Activity-Recognition-using-Smartphone-Data-with-Machine-Learning

<br>

<br>

### Introduction to the project: 

Human activity recognition is the problem of classifying sequences of data recorded by specialized harnesses or smart phones into known well-defined Human activities.

It is a challenging problem as the large number of observations are produced each second, the temporal nature of the observations, and the lack of a clear way to relate data to known movements increase the challenges.

In this Machine Learning Project, we will create a model for recognition of human activity using the smartphone data.
